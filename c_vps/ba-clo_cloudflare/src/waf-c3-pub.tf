# Geo-fence for the Cloudflare-proxied tier (#1104 routing tier pub, #1102 geo-fence).
# c3-pub.diegonmarcos.com is the only orange-cloud name, so Cloudflare is the only place that sees the
# real client country for it; the Caddy edge fences the grey hosts. The country set is NOT retyped here:
# geo-allowed.json is a generated copy of cloud-u-containers _shared/geo-fence.json allowed_countries,
# and a CI check there fails when the two differ. A country Cloudflare cannot place (XX, T1) is not in
# the set, so it is blocked too (fail closed).
# Plain block (default Cloudflare 403 page): the plan is not entitled to a custom response body (#1216).
